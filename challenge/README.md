## Challenges
---
To make the URL short all the challenges will have seperate directories with the main file named as **index.html** so that you only have to enter the directory name in the URL for the main file to show up.

E.g : www.domain.com/challenge/name/ => will show the main file

### Instruction

Each challenge directory should have a README.md file with the following format         
```
Author              : Alias or real name (link to their linkedin)
Challenge name      : challenge_name
Description         : should not exceed 100 words, if any additional instruction
                      is to be given a google doc file may be linked
Hints               : If any or else specify as None
Difficulty          : Easy/Medium/Hard/Insane
Points              : 50/100/200/350/500 venari
```
This is to make it easier for the administrators to handle them.

If you are someone other than the team trying to submit a challenge you'll have to submit a private offical writeup with the folder containing the main files and the markdown in the above format as a zip to example@gmail.com.      

For now the challenges are strictly web-based, we will extend to other categories in the near future.
