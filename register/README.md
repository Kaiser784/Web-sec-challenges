To include any css or js files:-    
- Create a folder in the main directory (where the manage.py resides) and name it **static**.    
- Create a sub-directory in it with the same name as that of the app.
```
Ex:-
static->register->main.css
```

To create/modify any html files for an app, do it in a templates sub-directory inside of that app's folder.
